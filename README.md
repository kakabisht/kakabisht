Hola, Yo Soy Hridyesh
currently, I am a 3rd-year B.TECH Information Technology student at Symbiosis Institute of Technology. I am very intrigued by Quantum computer, Applications of Renewable energy and Natural language processing. Apart from programming, I also write tech blogs and enjoy playing basketball or taking a swim or strumming a beat on my ukulele. I believe that "Engineering is the closest thing to magic that exists in the world".
